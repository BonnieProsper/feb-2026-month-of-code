# February of Code

A one-month challenge focused on shipping small, real-world projects. One project per day, each designed to:

* solve a concrete problem
* exercise a specific engineering skill
* be completed and documented in a single day

---

## Purpose

This challenge focuses on engineering judgment. Each project has:

* a defined user or purpose
* clear constraints and tradeoffs
* deliberate scope limits to avoid over-engineering

The one-day constraint enforces realistic decision-making and shipping discipline.

---

## Repository Structure

Each project lives in its own folder:

```
/day-01-project-name
/day-02-project-name
...
```

Each folder typically contains:

* `README.md` - problem description, approach, tradeoffs
* `src/` - implementation
* `tests/` - lightweight tests where relevant
* `data/` - sample inputs/outputs

Projects are self-contained. No shared framework is used, keeping each project simple and clear.

### Tradeoffs and Limitations

Every project README includes a section for:

* known limitations
* possible improvements with more time

---

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Storage:** CSV, SQLite, or other simple formats
* **Libraries:** minimal, standard library preferred unless external libraries are justified

---
